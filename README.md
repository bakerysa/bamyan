#Bakery HTML5 Boilerplate

Grunt HTML5 Boilerplate is an HTML5 boilerplate with added [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task management functionality.  It gives you an easy start to any web project by including the popular [Bootstrap Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) and also adds the workflow power of Grunt to output your code minified and easily organized.


##Getting Started

Clone the repo, install node modules and run grunt:
```
git clone https://github.com/tonyspiro/grunt-html5-boilerplate
cd grunt-html5-boilerplate
npm install
grunt
```
You can also run this command to watch files for edits:
```

```

Grunt will:<br>
1. Process your LESS files and minify your CSS into ONE MINIFIED CSS FILE.<br>
2. Lint your javascript for issues with JSHint.<br>
3. Minify and compile your javascript into ONE MINIFIED JAVACRIPT FILE.
